🔧 T-SQL scripts:  
Include performance tuning, monitoring, automation, T-SQL read/write Excel, and day-to-day SQL Server.

🚀 How to Use:  
Feel free to clone the repository or copy individual scripts.  
Review each script before execution—some require sysadmin or elevated permissions.  
Test in a non-production environment first.  
Modify as needed, but keep attribution (see License).
