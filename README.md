A collection of useful scripts I use as a SQL DBA and Fabric Data Engineer.

🔧 T-SQL scripts
include performance tuning, monitoring, automation, and day-to-day SQL Server.


🛠️ PySpark scripts 
include dataframe automation, REST API integration, and Lakehouse medallion architecture.


🚀 How to Use
Feel free to clone the repository or copy individual scripts.
Review each script before execution—some require sysadmin or elevated permissions.
Test in a non-production environment first.
Modify as needed, but keep attribution (see License).
